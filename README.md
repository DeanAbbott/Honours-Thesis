My thesis models hail insurance claims in South Africa using a Bayesian spatio-temporal approach with R-INLA. Using Momentum's historical claims as a proxy for hail events, I captured spatial and temporal trends to identify high-risk areas and periods, aiding risk assessment, pricing, and climate-based planning.
