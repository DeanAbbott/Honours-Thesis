# Hail Risk Modelling in South Africa using R-INLA

This project contains the core analysis and code from my Honours thesis in Statistics and Data Science at the University of Pretoria. The goal was to model hail insurance claim risk across South Africa using a Bayesian spatial framework, with real-world claim data from Momentum serving as a proxy for hail events.

## üìç Project Overview

- **Objective:** Estimate spatial hail risk using historical insurance claims data.
- **Methodology:** Bayesian hierarchical models via R-INLA and the SPDE approach.
- **Data:** Aggregated hail-related claims (coordinates, claim amount, date).
- **Tools:** R, INLA, ggplot2, sf, raster, tidyverse.

## üì¶ Key Components

- `code/mesh_creation.R`: Builds the spatial mesh over South Africa.
- `code/model_fitting.R`: Fits the spatial INLA model using log-transformed claim amounts.
- `code/plots.R`: Generates the figures for claims maps, density plots, and posterior risk surfaces.
- `figures/`: Contains key output images from the analysis.

## üîç Main Outputs

- Spatial mesh for INLA-SPDE
- Posterior risk surface (log claims)
- Monthly hail claim frequency trend
- Density plots of claims across SA

## üìò Thesis Summary

> In South Africa, direct hail event data is difficult to obtain. By using historical insurance claims as a proxy, this project applies Bayesian spatial models to identify high-risk zones for hail damage. The INLA framework with SPDE enabled flexible modelling over space, producing interpretable outputs and valuable insights for insurers.

## üöÄ Technologies Used

- **R**: Core analysis and modelling
- **INLA**: Latent Gaussian Models & SPDE
- **sf**: Spatial data handling
- **ggplot2**: Visualization
- **fields**: Mesh plotting and interpolation
